# AngelsDownwardAscent
A platforming Flash game, created in Stencyl, by Kevin Du, Nathan Hotz, and Rogelio Navarro. Music by David Lopez.
Created as a project for Dr. Paul Toprac's AET 318 course, at UT Austin, Spring 2017.

This is a light-hearted platformer in which you cannot attack enemies directly.
Instead, you must swing your sword at projectiles to return them to their sender.

Angels Downward Ascent.swf is the Flash game; run it with a Flash Player. The projector works well as a stand-alone player.
Angels Downward Ascent.stencyl is the source. You can import it into Stencyl to view and modify the game assets and code.
One song, entitled "Loading-Loop", was not by David Lopez, and was instead from here: https://www.dl-sounds.com/royalty-free/loading-loop/

Enjoy!
